## My process

I was stuck in <body> and <main> I don't know where am I gonna input the max-width and max-height in the end I inserted the two declarations to <main>. I also added a height: 100vh in the <body> and used display: flex, align-items: center, and lastly justify-content: center. So that I can center all the child elements of <body>.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I should really take the mobile responsiveness seriously. Know the differences of min and max in terms of width and height.
